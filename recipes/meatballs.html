    <h1>Swedish Meatballs</h1>
        <img src="../images/swedish_meatballs.jpg" alt="Plate of creamy swedish meatballs" height="600" width="720">
            <p>Swedish meatballs, perhaps the country's most famous culinary item, are actually based on a recipe brought back from Turkey in the early 18th century by King Charles XII of Sweden.
                 They are a part of both traditional holiday meals and a staple in everyday home cooking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 lb egg noodles</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Meatball Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent, about 2-3 minutes; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, egg yolks, allspice, nutmeg and onion. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Stir mixture with a wooden spoon until well combined. Use clean hands to roll the mixture into meatballs about 1 1/2-in in size (It should make about 20-24 meatballs).</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Add meatballs, in batches, and cook until all sides are browned, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sauce Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in the skillet. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in beef broth and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in sour cream; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in meatballs and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and thickened, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, and enjoy!</li>
